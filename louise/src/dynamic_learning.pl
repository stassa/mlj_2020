/** <module> Predicates for dynamic learning with predicate invention.

Dynamic learning differs to "static" learning (implemented by
learn/[1,2,5]) in that, as soon as a new generalising metasubstitution
is found (and given that the metasubstitution satisfies any constraints)
it is applied to its corresponding metarule and written to the dynamic
database so it can be re-used by further Top program construction steps.

This allows the construction of sets of metasubstitutions that, applied
to their metarules, result in sets of connected clauses. Two clauses, C
and D, are connected, iff one or more body literals of C unify with the
head literal of D.

In order to create sets of connected clauses, dynamic learning performs
predicate invention. When proving a body literal of a metarule during
the generalisation step of Top program construction fails, a new Top
program is constructed, recursively, with that literal as the only
positive example and with a new, invented predicate symbol. If a
non-empty Top program is constructed this way, it is taken as a
definition of the invented predicate.

An invented predicate's symbol is then used in a subsequently
constructed clause, to form a connected pair of clauses. More than two
clauses can be connected in this way. The ability to connect clauses
allows learning hypotheses that could otherwise only be learned by
specifying long metarules, with a potentially large number of body
literals.

Besides making heavy use of the dynamic database, dynamic learning
predicates also perform destructive updates of a counter used to keep
track of the number of invented predicates and also to construct their
names by indexing the atom '$' with the current highest invented
predicate index + 1.

Dynamic learning essentially updates the background knowledge by adding
each clause in the Top program (of the original target or an invented
predicate) to the dynamic database as soon as it is constructed. Because
of this, it relies very strongly on the order in which examples are
given. For example, given the first ordering of examples, below, 'S'/2
is learnable with dynamic learning, but given the second ordering, it is
not:

==
% 'S'([a,b],[]) must be found first before all other examples otherwise
% learning 'S'/2 with dynamic learning will fail
positive_example('S'/2,E):-
	member(E, ['S'([a,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,b,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,a,b,b,b],[])
		  ]).

?- learn_dynamic('S'/2).
'$1'(A,B):-'S'(A,C),'B'(C,B).
'S'(A,B):-'A'(A,C),'$1'(C,B).
'S'(A,B):-'A'(A,C),'B'(C,B).
true.

% This ordering makes 'S'/2 impossible to learn precisely with dynamic
% learning:
positive_example('S'/2,E):-
	member(E, ['S'([a,a,b,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,a,b,b,b],[])
		  ]).

?- learn_dynamic('S'/2).

%!	table_encapsulated(+Target) is det.
%
%	Prepare an encapsulated learning Target for tabling.
%
%	Target is a predicate indicator, F/A, the predicate symbol and
%	arity of a target predicate. table_encapsulated/1 prepares for
%	tabling the predicate m/N, where N is A+1. m/N is the predicate
%	encapsulating Target (though not necessarily _only_ target).
%
%	Motivation
%	----------
%
%	Tabling the predicate encapsulating a learning Target is a very
%	convenient way to avoid entering infinite recursion during
%	dynamic learning. Because dynamic learning adds to the dynamic
%	database clauses of the Top program learned in a previous
%	iteration, so that they may be called in subsequent iterations,
%	if a recursive clause is added to the dynamic database before a
%	suitable "base case" for the recursion is added, it's likely
%	that the learning procedure will enter an infinite recursion.
%	Tabling, implementing SLG resolution, avoids this and guarantees
%	termination by precomputing the result of recursive calls and
%	storing them in a table, so that execution does not have to
%	descend infinitely, like it does with ordinary SLDNF resolution.
%
%	@tbd Tabling is a new feature in Swi-Prolog and it may change
%	substantially in the future. For the time being, this predicate
%	works as intended. If tabling changes, this may have to change
%	also.

%
%	This is the counterpart to table_encapsulated/1.
%
%	Target is a predicate indicator, F/A, the predicate symbol and
%	arity of a target predicate. untable_encapsulated/1 removes
%	tabling from the predicate m/N, where N is A+1. m/N is the

%!	top_program_dynamic(+Counter,+Positive,+Negative,Metarules)
%!	is det.
%
%	Dynamically create the Top program for a MIL problem.
%
%	This predicate combines the generalisation and specialisation
%	step that are implemented by separate predicates in "static"
%	learning, in generalise/3 and specialise/3 in louise.pl.
%
%	top_program_dynamic/4 first attempts to generalise a positive
%	example using a metarule. The generalision attempt binds the
%	head of the metarule to the example and then proves each of the
%	body literals of the metarule, in turn, by resolution with the
%	positive examples and background knowledge.
%
%	If the proof of each body literal is successful, the resulting
%	metasubstitution is tested against constraints.
%
%	If the constraint test passes, the metasubstitution is
%	specialised against the negative examples. To specialise a
%	metasubstitution, first a negative example is bound to the head
%	of the metasubstitution, then its body literals are proven by
%	resolution against the positive examples and background
%	knowledge. If any such proof succeeds, which means that the
%	metasubstitution entails a negative example, the
%	metasubstitution is discarded.
%
%	During the generalisation step, if proof of a literal fails,
%	predicate invention is performed. This happens during a call to
%	prove_body_litearls_/3. The literal that cannot be proven given
%	the positive examples and background knowledge is given a new
%	predicate symbol, of the form '$n' where n is an integer from 1
%	to the maximum number of invented predicates set in the
%	configuration option max_invented/1. Then, a new Top program is
%	constructed with that literal as the only positive example, no
%	negative examples and the same background knowledge and
%	metarules as the original Top program construction step.
%
%	When a Top program construction step, i.e. the combination of
%	generalisation, specialisation and a constraint test, is
%	completed successfully, the resulting metasubstitution is first
%	applied to its corresponding metarule and written to the dynamic
%	database. Applying the metasubstitution to a metarule results
%	in a definite clause. The clause is encapsulated and so it
%	becomes immediately available to the next Top program
%	construction step, as a background predicate.
%
%	Metasubstitutions are later collected from the dynamic database
%	with a call to collect_clauses/3 and the dynamic database
%	cleaned of all encapsulated clauses.

%	tend to be the shortest clause. So consider the sorting a kind
