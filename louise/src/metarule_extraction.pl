/** <module> Extract metarules from first-order background knowledge.

Predicates in this module extract metarules from a definite program by
variabilising the program's clauses. Extracted metarules are
encapsulated and expanded into Louise's metarule notation, i.e.
into clauses where the head literal is a metasubstitution atom and the
first body literal is the encapsulated head literal of a metarule.

During metarule extraction predicate symbols in a program's clauses are
replaced with existentially quantified, second-order variables and
constants are replaced with universally quantified first order
variables. Identical terms are replaced with the same variable and any
variables pre-existing in a clauses are retained unchanged.

Note that, since all this is done in Prolog that has no concept of
existentially quantified variables or second-order terms, in practice
all variables in the output of predicates in this module are first-order
and (implicitly) universally quantified. That makes no difference in how
metarules are actually used.

A notable use of predicates in this module is to extract metarules from
the definitions of predicates declared as background knowledge for a
learning target.

Examples
========

1. program_metarules/2 is used to extract metarules from an arbitrary
list of definite clauses:

==
?- _Ps = [ p(_X,_Y):- q(_X,_Z), r(_Z,_Y), p(a,b) ]
  , program_metarules(_Ps, _MS), print_clauses(_MS).

m(metarule_1,A,B):-m(A,C,D),m(B,C,E).
true.
==

2. symbols_metarules/3 is used to extract metarules from a list of
predicate symbols and arities. The second argument is the name of a
module where the given predicates are defined, or a module importing
those predicates' definition module:

==
?- symbols_metarules([symbols_metarules/3], user, _MS)
  ,print_clauses(_MS).

m(metarule_1,A,B,C):-m(A,D,E,F),m(B,D,E,G),m(C,G,F).
true.

% Definition of symbols_metarules/3 in this file:
% symbols_metarules(Ss,M,MS):-
%	program(Ss, M, Ps)
%	,program_metarules(Ps, MS).
==

3. bk_metarules/2 is used to extract metarules from the definitions of
predicates declared as background for a learning target. Below,
metarules are extracted from the definitions of background predicates
for grandfather/2, one of the learning targets in
data/examples/tiny_kinship.pl (its BK predicates are also defined in
the same module):

==
?- bk_metarules(grandfather/2, _MS), print_clauses(_MS).
m(metarule_1,A,B):-m(A,C,D),m(B,C,D).
m(metarule_2,A,B,C):-m(A,D,E),m(B,D,F),m(C,E,F).
m(metarule_3,A,B,C):-m(A,D,E),m(B,D,F),m(C,F,E).
true.

% BK declaration for grandfather/2 in examples/tiny_kinship.pl:
% background_knowledge(grandfather/2,[father/2,parent/2,husband/2,grandmother/2]).

% Definitions of BK predicates for grandfather/2 in tiny_kinship.pl):
% parent(X, Y):- father(X,Y).
% parent(X, Y):- mother(X,Y).
%
% husband(X,Y):- father(X,Z) ,mother(Y,Z).
% grandmother(A,B):- mother(A,C) ,parent(C,B).
==

In the examples above, note that metarules are given generic names
consisting of the constant "metarule", followed by an underscore and a
numeric index, indicating the order of the metarule in the list of
metarules output by bk_metarules/2. There is no guarantee that such
metarule IDs will be in any way unique: the user is required to give
them unique names, perhaps evern meaningful names.

Limitations
-----------

A current limitation of metarule extraction is that constants are not
replaced with existentially quantified first-order variables.

For example, the program p(a,B):- q(a,B) should result in a metarule
m(metarule_1,P,Q,A):- m(P,A,B), m(Q,A,B), replacing the constant 'a'
with the existentially quantified first-order variable A.

Instead, the current version of metarule extraction will construct a
metarule such as m(metarule_1,P,Q):- m(P,A,B), m(Q,A,B) where the
constant 'a' is replaced by a first-order universally quantified
variable, thereby subtly altering the structure of the original clause.
This limitation will be addressed in future versions of this module.

%	for Target in the current experiment file.
%
%	Metarules are extracted by a call to symbols_metarules/3,
%	passing the predicate symbols of the background predicates, and

%
%	Symbols is a list of predicate indicators, the symbols and
%	arities of predicates in a program from which mearules are to be
%	extracted. The program must be visible to the given Module (i.e.
%	either defined in that Module, or imported to it from another
%	module).

%
%	Program is a list of first-order definite clauses. Metarules is
%	a list of metarules such that each non-unit clause in Program is
%	an instantiation of a Metarule in Metarules.
%
%	Metarules in the output list are encapsulated and expanded
%	into Louise's metarule notation. Metasubstitution atoms in
%	extracted metarules are given generic metarule IDs, consisting
%	of the constant "metarule" followed by an underscore and a
%	number, the position of the metarule in the list, Metarules.
%	These numbered metarule IDs are by no means guaranteed to be
%	unique and it is expected that the user will inspect the
%	metarules resulting from a call to this predicate and assign
%	unique names to the ones she wants to keep, perhaps even
%	meaningful names if that is at all possible.
%
%	Note that Metarules are not extracted from unit clauses. Such
%	metarules are usually of the form m(P,A,B) and not particularly
%	useful in practice.
%
%	@bug This predicate currently replaces constants in the head and
%	body literals of clauses with universally quantified variables,

%	Metarules.
%
%	@tbd This predicate is called at the end of processing in
