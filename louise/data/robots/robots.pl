/** <module> Grid worl navigation.

Generates grid worlds with various elements as a learning environment
for navigation strategies.

Full documentation pending. Note that training with the full dataset can
take a very long time. Try this kind of query instead:

==
?- train_and_test(move/2,1,_Ps,acc,V), print_clauses(_Ps).
==

Predictive accuracy should be very low, since a single example is
selected, but learning will be quick and you'll have a chance to inspect
the results. Training with multiple examples tends to generate _very_
large programs! That's because each training example is a navigation
task with multiple solutions (multiple paths between each two points A
and B in the grid world, unless of course A = B) and each sub-hypothesis
is a single clause. As the problem grows, so does the number of
"alternatives", so this is even more evident in larger worlds. Training
on a 4x4 grid with a 0.9 sampling rate can generate programs of more
than 2k clauses. If you do that it's a good idea to not print the
results in the console. You've been warned!

%
%	True when Move is an atom of a higher-order move.
%
%	It is convenient to interpret higher order moves differently
%	than primitive and composite moves- because higher order moves
%	are defined in terms of meta-calls, i.e. with call/[2,3,4] etc.
%	Meta-calls are not easily interpretable by means of a

%	Move is a ground move/2 atom, a grid world navigation task.
%	Moves is a sequence of moves representing a trace of a learned

%	move in Moves is unbound so rendering one of a move's states
%	will not render the goal. This predicate ensures that the
